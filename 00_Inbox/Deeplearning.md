Deep Learning

Description

Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered structure algorithms called Artificial Neural Networks ([[ANN]]).

Unlike traditional machine learning, which often requires manual feature extraction, Deep Learning automates this by learning hierarchical representations of data directly from raw input (like pixels in an image).
